## Introduction
I am a Master's student at [Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)](https://aut.ac.ir/en) pursuing a degree in computer engineering. My specialization focuses on deep learning and computer vision. I obtained my undergraduate degree in computer engineering from [Kharazmi University](http://www.khu.ac.ir/en/) and have since dedicated my academic journey to the development of practical methodologies in deep learning and machine learning, particularly in the context of supervised learning tasks.
My passion is centered on the application of these methodologies within the fields of computer vision and image processing. I am particularly interested in the processing of medical images, where the application of deep learning can bring significant advancements. Currently, my research is deeply engaged in exploring the potential of vision transformer networks for tasks such as detection and classification. This ongoing work fuels my enthusiasm for the exciting possibilities within the field of artificial intelligence.

## Research Interests
My primary research interest lies at the intersection of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision, with a specific focus on Image Processing and Medical Image Analysis. I am deeply passionate about advancing the frontiers of artificial intelligence, particularly through the development and application of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in the realm of computer vision. The field of Computer Vision captivates me due to its potential to revolutionize industries ranging from healthcare to autonomous vehicles. In this context, I aim to leverage the power of deep learning models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of image processing. I am driven by the opportunity to make significant contributions in the development of AI-driven solutions for medical diagnostics, enabling more accurate and timely disease detection, ultimately improving patient outcomes and healthcare delivery. My research endeavors are geared toward addressing the complex challenges in this interdisciplinary field and propelling the advancement of AI applications in the healthcare domain.

## Education
I will be graduating with a Master's in Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence) from Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic) with a GPA of 3.31. My thesis, titled "Cancer Detection in Medical Images," explores the implementation of a cutting-edge vision transformer-based neural network for breast cancer classification. Extensive research was conducted, focusing on historical methods and deep learning techniques for this critical medical task. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering ( Software Engineering ) from Kharazmi University of Tehran, achieving GPA of 3.70. My Bachelor's Project involved the creation of a Python and Django-based Cloud system, tailored to optimize the administration of operating systems within university labs. This cutting-edge innovation marks a substantial advancement by enhancing privacy, fortifying security, and improving operational efficiency, thereby redefining the approach to OS management in academic settings.
