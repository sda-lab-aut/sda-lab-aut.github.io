I am currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Amirkabir University of Technology, under the guidance of [Prof. AmirMazlaghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxbTUfEAAAAJ&hl=en). The focus of my thesis is "medical anomaly detection in MRI".
My interests lie in exploring principled solutions to challenges in machine learning and data science, utilizing tools from probability, statistics, information theory, and optimization.

> I explore how to give computers the ability to learn anythingâ€”except, perhaps, my bad habits!
