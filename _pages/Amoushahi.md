As a dedicated student of artificial intelligence, I am driven by a profound curiosity to explore the frontiers of technology and its potential to transform society. My journey began with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Isfahan, where I cultivated a solid foundation in programming, mathematics, and engineering principles. This foundational knowledge propelled me into pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Amirkabir University of Technology, where I have delved deeper into cutting-edge research and practical applications of AI. Currently, I am a member of the SDA Lab, working with [Prof. AmirMazlaghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxbTUfEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Through coursework and research projects, I have honed my skills in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, gaining hands-on experience with tools and frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. My thesis focuses on cardiac MRI segmentation, demonstrating my commitment to advancing medical imaging technologies for improved diagnosis and treatment of heart conditions.
