## Doctorate Thesis
My doctoral research focuses on the analysis of functional connectivity in the brain using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. The inherent graph structure of the brain's functional connectivity network makes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) an ideal choice for this task. 
However, fMRI data is not merely a graph. It is a large multi-variate time series with spatial-temporal dimensions, and intrinsically, it is a 4-dimensional point cloud. This unique nature of fMRI data has been underexplored in the existing literature on learning brain functional connectivity.  In my dissertation, I aim to address this research gap by developing a GNN-based model that encapsulates all these aspects of fMRI data. The ultimate objective is to leverage these insights to develop predictive models that can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.
