I am Saeed Saravani, an M.Sc. graduate student deeply passionate about artificial intelligence. My research primarily focuses on Graph Neural Networks. Additionally, I have a keen interest in generative AI and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Since 2022, I've been serving as a project mentor for undergraduates at the SDA Lab. I'm dedicated to pursuing research in AI and aspire to contribute my insights to top-tier journals and conferences.
