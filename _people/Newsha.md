I am a master's student currently pursuing my studies in Artificial Intelligence with a focus on explainable and interpretable deep models for medical images. Alongside my academic pursuits, I also have a keen interest in psychology and find great enjoyment in exploring this field. Under the guidance of [Dr. Rahmati](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EYk7M80AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Amirmazlaghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gxbTUfEAAAAJ&hl=en), I am actively involved in research that aims to bridge the gap between advanced machine learning techniques and the healthcare domain.
Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience in various computer vision and machine learning techniques. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, along with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, enabling me to implement state-of-the-art algorithms and models.
