abstract = {Graph embedding learning is a fundamental task when dealing with diverse datasets. While encoder–decoder architectures, such as U-Nets, have shown great success in image pixel-wise prediction tasks, applying similar methods to graph data poses challenges due to the lack of natural pooling and up-sampling operations for graphs. Recent methods leverage learnable parameters to extract structural information from neural networks and extend pooling and unpooling to graphs using node features and graph structural information. This paper proposes a novel model called GIUNet (Graph Isomorphism U-Net) for the graph classification task. The proposed Graph U-Net structure is based on graph isomorphism convolution while using a comprehensive pqPooling layer. The pqPooling layer in our approach effectively combines node features and graph structure information during the graph down-sampling stage. To incorporate graph structure information, we utilize both the spectral representation and node centrality measurements. Node centrality measurements capture various structural aspects of nodes in the graph, while the spectral representation helps us focus on the informative low-frequency components of the graph structure. Through ablation studies, we have demonstrated that leveraging the GIUNet model leads to significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmark datasets.}

abstract = {Utilizing a meaningful graph plays an essential part in the performance of graph-based algorithms. However, a ground-truth graph representing the relationships between data points is not readily available in many applications. This paper proposes a graph learning method based on sensitivity analysis over a deep learning framework called GL-SADL. The proposed method is composed of two steps. First, it estimates the signal value for each vertex using the signal values corresponding to the other vertices with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) block. Then a sensitivity analysis approach is applied to each DNN block to determine how the input signal values influence the DNN’s response. This procedure leads us to the underlying graph structure. The utilization of DNNs allows us to take advantage of the non-linearity characteristics of neural networks in modeling the observed graph signals. In addition, since the DNNs are considered as general approximators, there is no need to make any prior assumptions about the distribution of the observed graph signals. Experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can infer meaningful graph structures from observed graph signals.}

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
